# METAPHOR-DETECTION
METAPHOR DETECTION USING TRANSFER LEARNING 

This project focuses on building a metaphor detection model using transfer learning. The goal is to leverage pre-trained language models and adapt them for the specific task of identifying metaphors in textual data. Transfer learning allows the model to benefit from the knowledge learned on a large dataset, enhancing performance on a metaphor detection task with a potential datasets
